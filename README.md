## Project Introduction
We plan to make an Encryption & Decryption project (if possible, we would make it a website) because we think it is very interesting.

Implement 3 common encryption algorithms (from the easiest to the hardest): Morse Code, Caesar cipher, AES(Advanced Encryption Standard).

## Technical Overview
Plan to finish before the first checkpoint (11/6 to 11/11): 
1. Understand the Encryption & Decryption algorithms. 
2. Finish writing the rust codes for Morse Code, Caesar cipher (without visualizing).

Plan to finish before the second checkpoint (11/27 to 12/1):
1. Finish writing the rust codes for AES Encryption. 
2. Visualizing all the Encryption & Decryption, create a website include all the blocks for inputing and outputing.

## Possible Challenges
Matrix calculation in rust. 

Creating websites and visualization.

Communication with teammates!
